# TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ)
This project was created to expand my knowledge of quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and the intersection between the two fields. Currently, I am following the tutorials at https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/overview (and the repository reflects that), however I plan on using the knowledge gained for future projects (quantum machine learning and similar; recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks for image processing, etc.). Google's TensorFlow project is licensed under Apache License 2.0.

The experiments and concepts here are not likely to be idiomatic; I wouldn't use this as a production-quality reference, but rather a stepping stone for learning. I am documenting my learning adventure here and will be sharing interesting and useful pieces of information as I discover them.

# Dependencies
The required dependencies are in `requirements.txt`, and can be installed (ideally within a virtual environment) with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. For an example of creating a virtual environment with the `virtualenv` tool, reference https://gist.github.com/coopbri/6b8db94c6c3adb5b902362cd803184cc.
