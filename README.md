# TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ)
This project was created to expand my knowledge of quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and the intersection between the two fields. Currently, I am following the tutorials at https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/overview (and the repository reflects that), however I plan on using the knowledge gained for future projects (quantum machine learning and similar).

# Dependencies
The required dependencies are in `requirements.txt`, and can be installed (ideally within a virtual environment) with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
